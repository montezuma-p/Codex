## What does it do?
- Reads text files (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`, `.py`, etc.) present in the project folder.
- Returns the file content safely, limiting the response to avoid huge prints.
- Informs if the file is empty or does not exist.

## Usage examples
- **User:** "Codex, read the file README.md"
- **Codex:**
  ```
  Content of 'README.md':
  # Codex â€“ Learning with APIs, AI, and Project Automation
  ...
  ```

- **User:** "Show the content of teste_codex.txt"
- **Codex:**
  ```
  Content of 'teste_codex.txt':
  this is a Codex test
  ```

- **User:** "Read the file that does not exist"
- **Codex:**
  ```
  [ERROR]: File 'arquivo_que_nao_existe.txt' not found.
  ```
